# Lab6_Lottery
This project is a lottery simulator. This implementation demonstrates passing an array as a function parameter.
lottery.cpp holds all function prototypes, definitions, and main.cpp. 
Before the user enters their lottery number, an array is initialized with random number values to represent lottery numbers. There are no duplicate numbers in the array.
After the user inputs their number, the number is checked to see if it is in the array. If the number is in the array, the user wins. If the number does not appear in the array, the user loses and all of the lottery numbers are displayed.
